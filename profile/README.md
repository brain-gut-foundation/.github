**The Brain–Gut Foundation** is a public-interest initiative dedicated to publishing **open protocols for evidence-based brain–gut interventions**.

Our aim is to make scientifically grounded methods in brain–gut science more **transparent, reproducible, and globally accessible**, while maintaining clear boundaries around evidence, safety, and scope.

## What we do

The Foundation supports and publishes:

- Open, evidence-based intervention protocols  
- Clear definitions of protocol structure and fidelity  
- Standards for transparency, reproducibility, and translation  
- Educational material that helps the public and professionals understand brain–gut research  

All material is grounded in **peer-reviewed science** and clearly labeled by evidence level.

## What we do not do

The Foundation does **not**:

- Provide medical advice, diagnosis, or personalized therapy  
- Promote commercial products or services  
- Make claims of cure or guaranteed outcomes  
- Replace professional clinical care  

All published material is intended for **educational, research, and implementation reference purposes only**.
